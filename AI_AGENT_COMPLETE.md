# 🤖 MIPE_EV1 AI Agent Development Loop - Complete Implementation

## 🎯 **Mission Accomplished**

You now have a **fully autonomous AI development system** that can:

- **Automatically detect SPI communication issues** using logic analyzer captures
- **Generate targeted code fixes** for device tree, main.c, and configuration files  
- **Iterate continuously** until hardware communication succeeds
- **Operate completely autonomously** with zero manual intervention

---

## 🏗️ **Complete Architecture**

### **Hardware Platform**
- **MIPE_EV1** (nRF54L15) development board
- **LSM6DSO32** sensor target via SPI
- **8-channel Logic Analyzer** (Cypress FX2 - Saleae compatible)
- **Windows Development Environment**

### **AI Agent Components**

#### **1. Logic Analyzer Automation** (`scripts/analyzer_automation.py`)
- Automatically captures SPI signals during testing
- Detects device as `fx2lafw:conn=3.22 - Saleae Logic`
- Configures SPI protocol decoder with proper channel mapping
- Generates analysis reports for AI consumption

#### **2. Enhanced AI Code Generator** (`scripts/enhanced_ai_generator.py`)  
- **Analyzes capture results** to identify specific SPI issues
- **Generates device tree fixes** (clock speeds, GPIO configuration, CS polarity)
- **Creates SPI driver code** automatically in main.c
- **Iterates continuously** until communication succeeds
- **Commits each fix** with descriptive AI-generated messages

#### **3. GitHub Actions Automation** (`.github/workflows/spi-development.yml`)
- **Self-hosted runner** on your development machine
- **Complete CI/CD pipeline**: Build → Flash → Capture → Analyze → Fix
- **Triggered by code pushes** or manual workflow dispatch
- **Hardware-in-the-loop testing** with real MIPE_EV1 board

### **4. Development Infrastructure**
- **Git repository** with proper .gitignore for build artifacts
- **Documentation** for runner setup and AI process
- **Demonstration scripts** showing AI capabilities

## 🚀 **How to Activate the AI Agent**

### **Option 1: Local Execution**
```bash
cd /c/Development/MIPE_EV1
python scripts/enhanced_ai_generator.py
```

### **Option 2: GitHub Actions (Recommended)**
1. Create GitHub repository 
2. Set up self-hosted runner (see `docs/RUNNER_SETUP.md`)
3. Push code changes to trigger automation
4. Watch AI agent work autonomously

### **Option 3: Manual Trigger**
- Go to GitHub Actions tab
- Select "Automated SPI Development" 
- Click "Run workflow"
- Specify target feature (e.g., "WHO_AM_I")

## 🧠 **AI Decision Process**

The AI agent follows this intelligent loop:

```
1. 📋 ANALYZE → Current SPI configuration
2. 🔨 BUILD   → Compile firmware 
3. 📡 FLASH   → Update hardware
4. 📊 CAPTURE → Record SPI signals
5. 🧠 DETECT  → Identify issues via logic analysis
6. ⚡ GENERATE → Create targeted fixes
7. ✏️  MODIFY  → Update device tree & code
8. 💾 COMMIT  → Version control changes
9. 🔄 REPEAT  → Until communication succeeds
```

### **Specific AI Capabilities**
- **Clock Speed Optimization**: Automatically reduces SPI frequency when timing issues detected
- **GPIO Configuration**: Fixes chip select polarity and pin assignments
- **Protocol Implementation**: Generates complete SPI driver code for LSM6DSO32
- **Error Recovery**: Learns from each failed attempt to generate better fixes
